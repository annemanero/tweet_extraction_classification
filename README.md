# tweet_extraction_classification
This is a tutorial for a Machine Learning II course where I show how I retrieve tweets from Twitter App and visualize, cluster and classify data in R by means of ML techniques and algorithms. This is a beginner's introduction to ML, results are not optimal and the process needs to be improved.
